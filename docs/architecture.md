# PySaaS Architecture Overview

This document details the architectural principles, technology stack, and high-level design of the PySaaS project. It outlines how individual components will interact to form a scalable, resilient, and maintainable SaaS platform built primarily with Python.

---

## 1. Core Principles

The PySaaS architecture adheres to the following core principles:

- **Microservices-Oriented:** The application will be composed of loosely coupled, independently deployable microservices. Each service will encapsulate a specific business capability.
- **API-First Design:** All interactions between services and with external clients will be via well-defined, RESTful (or gRPC for internal communication) APIs.
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Services will communicate asynchronously via message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for better decoupling and scalability.
- **Scalability & Resilience:** Designed for horizontal scalability, allowing individual services to scale independently. Redundancy and fault tolerance will be built in.
- **Cloud-Native:** Leverages cloud services and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) for flexible deployment and management.
- **Security Best Practices:** Security is a fundamental aspect, implemented at every layer, including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and secure coding practices.
- **Observability:** Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing will be integrated to provide visibility into the system's health and performance.
- **Data Consistency (Eventual):** While strong consistency may be required for critical transactions, overall system consistency will lean towards eventual consistency across services to support scalability.

## 2. Technology Stack

### Backend & Services

- **Primary Framework:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - For building high-performance, asynchronous APIs. Its automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc) is a significant advantage.
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ as a broker for background tasks.
- **Database ORM/Client:** [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) (for relational) or specific client libraries for NoSQL databases.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT-based authentication, with integration into the Auth service. OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect will be considered for external identity providers.

### Databases

- **Transactional Relational Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - For core business data requiring strong consistency and ACID properties (e.g., user accounts, billing transactions).
- **NoSQL Database (User Profiles/Preferences):** [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) (or equivalent localstack for local dev) - For high-throughput, low-latency key-value data, especially for frequently accessed user profiles or preferences that don't require complex relational queries.
- **Caching/Session Management:** [Redis](https://redis.io/) - For rapid data retrieval, session storage, rate limiting, and message brokering (for Celery).

### Messaging & Queues

- **Message Broker (High-throughput):** [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) - For high-volume, fault-tolerant, and durable message streaming (e.g., event logs, analytics streams).
- **Message Broker (General Purpose/Queuing):** [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) - For general-purpose message queuing, task distribution (e.g., for Celery), and inter-service communication where strict ordering/durability is less critical than simple queuing.

### Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Containerization:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - For packaging microservices into portable, self-contained units.
- **Container Orchestration:** [Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io/) - For automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Local Kubernetes Cluster:** [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) (with Podman driver) - For local development and testing of Kubernetes deployments.
- **Secrets Management:** [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault) - For centrally managing and distributing secrets to services securely.

### Frontend

- **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js Framework - This will likely be integrated as a separate repository or shared module that can consume the PySaaS APIs, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

## 3. Monorepo Structure

The project will follow a monorepo structure to manage multiple services and applications within a single repository, leveraging tools like Poetry for dependency management across services.

- `services/`: Python microservices (e.g., `auth`, `billing`, `notification`). Each sub-directory will be a Poetry-managed Python package.
- `frontend/`: Placeholder for React/Next.js frontend applications.
- `docs/`: Comprehensive project documentation, including architecture, development workflow, and guidelines.
- `scripts/`: Automation scripts for build, test, deploy, and development environment setup.
- `infra/`: Infrastructure-as-Code definitions (e.g., Kubernetes YAMLs, Terraform).

## 4. Service Interaction Patterns

- **Synchronous:** RESTful API calls for immediate request-response interactions (e.g., client -> API Gateway -> service).
- **Asynchronous:** Message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for event-driven processing, background tasks, and inter-service communication that doesn't require an immediate response.
- **API Gateway:** A single entry point for external clients, routing requests to appropriate microservices and potentially handling authentication/rate limiting.

## 5. Data Flow (High-Level)

1.  **Client Request:** Frontend or external client makes an API call to the API Gateway.
2.  **API Gateway:** Authenticates the request (if required), routes it to the relevant microservice.
3.  **Microservice:** Processes the request, interacts with its dedicated database(s), and may publish events to a message broker.
4.  **Message Broker:** Distributes events to other interested microservices for asynchronous processing.
5.  **Database:** Stores and retrieves data for individual services.
