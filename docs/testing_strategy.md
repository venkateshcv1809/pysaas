# PySaaS Testing Strategy

This document defines the testing strategy for the PySaaS project. A robust testing approach is crucial for ensuring the quality, reliability, and maintainability of our microservices-oriented application. We aim for a balanced testing pyramid that includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, supported by a strong CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 1. Testing Principles

- **Automated First:** Prioritize automated tests over manual testing where feasible.
- **Early & Often:** Integrate testing early in the development cycle and run tests frequently.
- **Maintainability:** Tests should be easy to write, understand, and maintain.
- **Reliability:** Tests should be deterministic and produce consistent results.
- **Speed:** Strive for fast test execution, especially for unit tests, to enable quick feedback loops.
- **Clear Scope:** Each test should have a clear purpose and test a specific piece of functionality.
- **Isolation:** Tests should be isolated from each other to prevent side effects.

## 2. Testing Pyramid

We will follow the standard testing pyramid approach:

### a. Unit Tests (Base of the Pyramid)

- **Purpose:** Test individual functions, methods, or small components in isolation. They verify that the smallest testable parts of the application work as expected.
- **Scope:** Focus on a single logical unit. Mock external dependencies (e.g., database calls, API requests, other services) to ensure isolation.
- **Tools:**
  - **Pytest:** The primary testing framework for Python.
  - **pytest-mock:** For mocking dependencies within tests.
- **Characteristics:** Fast execution, high number of tests, provide quick feedback.
- **Coverage Target:** Aim for high unit test coverage (e.g., 80%+).

### b. Integration Tests (Middle of the Pyramid)

- **Purpose:** Verify the interactions between different units or components, and with external dependencies (e.g., database, message queues, other microservices).
- **Scope:** Test how modules or services integrate. May use real external dependencies (e.g., a test database instance) or well-defined test doubles for complex systems.
- **Tools:**
  - **Pytest**
  - **Testcontainers (Python library):** For spinning up real external dependencies (databases, message brokers) in Docker containers for testing.
- **Characteristics:** Slower than unit tests, provide confidence in component interactions. Fewer in number than unit tests.

### c. End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Top of the Pyramid)

- **Purpose:** Simulate real user scenarios and test the entire system flow from start to finish, including the UI, backend services, and databases. They verify that the complete application works as expected from a user's perspective.
- **Scope:** Broadest scope, involves all layers of the application. Run against a deployed staging or testing environment.
- **Tools (Potential):**
  - **Selenium/Playwright:** For browser automation if there's a coupled frontend.
  - **API-level E2E tests:** Using requests or similar libraries to test the full API flow across multiple services.
- **Characteristics:** Slowest execution, most expensive to maintain, fewest in number. Provide high confidence in overall system health.

## 3. Test Directory Structure

- Tests will reside in a `tests/` directory at the root of each Python microservice (`services/<service_name>/tests/`).
- Within `tests/`, organize by test type (e.g., `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/`) or by the module being tested.

  **Example:**
  `      services/
      └── auth_service/
          ├── src/
          │   ├── __init__.py
          │   └── user.py
          └── tests/
              ├── __init__.py
              ├── conftest.py  # pytest fixtures
              ├── unit/
              │   └── test_user.py
              └── integration/
                  └── test_auth_api.py
     `

## 4. Running Tests

- **Local Execution:** Developers should run relevant unit and integration tests locally before pushing code.

  ```bash
  # Run all tests in the monorepo
  poetry run pytest

  # Run tests for a specific service (from monorepo root)
  cd services/<service_name> && poetry run pytest
  ```

- **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**
  - All Pull Requests will trigger a comprehensive test suite run (unit and integration tests).
  - E2E tests will run less frequently, possibly on merges to `develop` or `main` branches, or as part of a release pipeline.
  - Test reports and code coverage reports will be generated and published.

## 5. Test Data Management

- **Unit Tests:** Use mocked data or simple in-memory data structures.
- **Integration Tests:** Use dedicated test databases (e.g., via Testcontainers) that are reset or recreated for each test run or test suite. Avoid polluting development or production databases.
- **E2E Tests:** Use a dedicated test environment with realistic but synthetic data. Ensure data can be reset or cleaned up between runs.
